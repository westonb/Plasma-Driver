# Plasma-Driver
A 40W 40.68MHz Class E RF amplifier using a MRF101AN LDMOS Device. The amplifer accepts a 40.68MHz square wave logic level input. A 5V power supply is required for the driver and a DC input of 38V is required to acheive a 40W output. 

## PCB
The PCB directory contains the kicad PCB files for the class E design and for a linear amplifier based on the 40.68MHz refrence design provided in the MRF101AN datasheet

## Schematic 
The schematics directory contains a PDF schematic of the design 

## Simulation 
The simulation directory contains a LTSpice simulation of the amplifier using a model of the MRF101AN derived from the datasheet and in-circuit testing
